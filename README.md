# 🎬 SceneLab – Learn Video Editing and Filmmaking

**SceneLab** is a modern, evolving web-based academy designed to teach video editing, directing, motion graphics, and creative media production. Built entirely with HTML and CSS at this stage, SceneLab will grow continuously as the developer expands skills in JavaScript, backend technologies, and interactive design.

> This is not just a project — it's a long-term journey of learning, creativity, and building a complete, professional-grade platform step by step.

## 🚀 Project Philosophy
SceneLab is designed to evolve alongside its developer. Every time a new concept or technique is learned, it is directly applied to the project. This includes:

- Continuous enhancement of layout, interactivity, and design  
- Modular updates to CSS and UI components  
- Implementation of future support services and admin tools  
- A growing reflection of personal growth in front-end and back-end development  

The platform also follows a **mobile-first design approach**, ensuring full responsiveness and accessibility across all screen sizes.
